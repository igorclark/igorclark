🙋🏻‍♂️ I'm tech director at [ArtRabbit 🐇](https://www.artrabbit.com). I also do a variety of freelance tech consulting & development work, mostly with my hands in the code.

🤖 Particularly enjoy working on software systems for live and real-time installations and [experiences](https://audienceofthefuture.live/dream/), particularly when using [Erlang/OTP](https://www.erlang.org) and/or [OpenResty](https://www.openresty.org).

🖥 Most of my public repos here on GitHub are either backup dumps or freeze-forks I've taken of libraries I needed to tweak for a project.

📫 To get in touch for work, hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igorclark).

📲 For anything else: email me at `my-first-name` at [my-personal-domain](https://igorclark.net/).
